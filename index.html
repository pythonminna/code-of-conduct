<h1>Python Users Nigeria Community in Minna, Niger State Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>The Python community in Minna, Niger State is made up of members from around Nigeria (Online or Offline) with very diverse set of skills, personalities, cultures and experiences. It is through these differences that this community will be built upon to enable efficient interaction and continued growth. Moving forward as a community, we encourage you to be guided with these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep Python Nigeria, Minna Community a positive, successful, and growing community.</p>

<p><strong>A Member of the Nigeria Python community is:</p></strong>

<p><strong><h3>Open</p></strong></h3>

<p>Members of the community are open to collaboration. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.</p>

<p><strong><h3>Considerate</p></strong></h3>

<p>Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other Python users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labour was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.</p>

<p><strong><h3>Respectful</p></strong></h3>

<p>Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues</p>

<p>Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.</p>
